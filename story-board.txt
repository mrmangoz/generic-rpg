Intro:

* Start on the road towards small mountainside village.
* Two screens until you arrive
  - initial starting screens
  - one more along the road where an event takes place
* First Event:
  - encounter a slime enemy
  - slime enemy drops slime and a mysterious key (key will be used later on)
* This is the end of the intro (intro will be used as a tutorial, not skippable)
* Next screen is the entrance to the village, which has been shut and has a guard posted

NOTES:

* You can go between screens
* Some coins are available to loot - part of the tutorial
* tutorial is setup with signs so as to keep the game moving, and to allow tutorial to be soft - skipped

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Entrance Screen:

* You can talk to the guard - however he will not let you in.
  - he says there are too many slimes to be letting strangers in
* After the initial interaction he will just say "..." and not let you in
* You then have the option to go up or down a screen, but those screens are dead - ends
  - you have to give the guard the slime you picked up on the second screen for him to unlock the gate

NOTES:

* No lootables on entrance screen
* More slimes up and down screens
* Going up a screen there is a chest with a potion and some coins
